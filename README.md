## Overview

**TimelessMS** is our attempt at bringing back Classic Maplestory. We aim to build a server that will bring back the important core aspects of the original PreBigBang era and as time goes on improve upon them. Features and goals will become player driven as the server evolves past the vanilla experience.

The issues tracked here will help us stay organized and ensure that critical bugs are addressed, and that features are developed as per the design vision for **TimelessMS**. It is also here to provide future players with updates on the current status of the server.
